# Shoot and share

![app screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuandahanif/shoot-and-share/master/src/screenshot/bg.png)

I made this app to improve React Native skills, and do some fun with javascript. 
This app is inspired by Instagram, where users share their photos with others.

I focus on state management and Firebase, so I don't do much on UI / UX.

Backend using [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

Using [CodePush](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push) to deploy mobile app updates directly.

Push notification using [One Signal](https://onesignal.com/).
