# Shoot and share

![app screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuandahanif/shoot-and-share/master/src/screenshot/bg.png)

i make this app to improve my react native skill, and do some fun with javascript, nothing else.
this app inspired by [Instagram](http://https://www.instagram.com), where the user share their photo with the other.

i focused on state management and Firebase so i don't do much on UI/UX.
